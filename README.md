# Neuronal selectivity for multiple features in the primary visual cortex
Wenqing Wei, Benjamin Merkt, Stefan Rotter

This is the code used for running simulations and visualizing results in the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.07.18.500396).

## Getting Started
The Python files within this repository whose names commence with ‘fig_’ comprise three parts:
1. Numerical (NEST) / Analytical simulation
2. Analysis of the simulation data
3. Visualisation, i.e. plotting out the figures in the paper

### Prerequisites
Python 2.7 or later (Packages: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc)\
[NEST 2.20.0](https://www.nest-simulator.org)

### Resources
The core part of the code has been tested on a local PC (4 Core with 8 GB of Memory). It takes up to few minutes for running the numerical simulation of the entire feedforward network once,
i.e. for one stimulus orientation. For generating transfer function of a single LIF neuron, it is also quite fast with the local PC.
